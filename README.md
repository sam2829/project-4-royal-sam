## Project Goals

This is my fourth portfolio project for the Code Institute and my goal with this project is to display my new skills in using frameworks such as Django and Bootstrap. I decided to build a site for a golf club which allows users to book and manage there tee times and also being able to leave reviews and comments about the golf club.
